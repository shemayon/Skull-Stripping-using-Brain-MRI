# Skull-Stripping-using-Brain-MRI

Skull stripping, an essential step in brain MRI analysis, involves removing non-brain tissues to isolate the brain for further processing. In this project, I try employ OpenCV and the Otsu method to segment the brain from MRI images. The approach utilizes image registration techniques to refine the skull stripping process.

The resulting skull-stripped images allow for more accurate analysis of brain structures. Successfully can visualize the outer boundary of the brain to provide insights into the brain's shape and size.
